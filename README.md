## Description
This project uses the Three.js library to create a realistic 3D globe with rotating satellites. The globe is textured with a high-resolution image of the Earth, and the satellites are animated to follow elliptical orbits. The background soundtrack is a calming piano melody that adds to the overall ambiance of the project.

## Features

* Realistic 3D globe with rotating satellites
* High-resolution textures for the globe and satellites
* Soothing background soundtrack
* Interactive controls for zooming and rotating the globe
* Compatible with desktop and mobile devices

## Requirements

* A modern web browser with WebGL support
* A device with a compatible operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS)

## Usage
To view the 3D globe, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. You can use the mouse or touch controls to zoom and rotate the globe. The background soundtrack will play automatically, but you can adjust the volume or pause the music using the controls in the bottom left corner of the screen.
